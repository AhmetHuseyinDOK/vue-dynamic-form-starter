# Dynamic Form Starter

EXPERIMENTAL!! 

I am looking for ways to dynamically render forms for configurable forms from backend with your own components. So I started this repo. You can have look at a sample dynamic form with validations [here](https://github.com/AhmetHuseyinDOK/vue-dynamic-form-starter/blob/main/src/App.vue).

## RoadMap

[x] form-valid utility

[x] Handle errors from server

[x] Fetch data from remote

[x] Components with childs

[x] DateTime Component

[x] File Upload

[] Documentation

[] Visual Builder
